# Practical Instances
The 240 instances are modified instances from Krebs et al. (2021). 

The name of each file consists in four elements:
- the instance number
- the number of customers
- the number of boxes
- the number of item types

The structure of an instance is as follows:
1. the name of the instance
2. the number of customers
3. the number of boxes
4. the number of item types
5. the number of vehicles (fleet size)
6. description of the vehicle type (weight, length, width, height) and the maximum working (driving, waiting, service) duration of the driver
7. customers information: id of the customer - x location - y location - total demand - ReadyTime - DueDate - ServiceTime
8. items information : type id - length - width - height - mass
9. demands per customers: the customer id followed by the box type and the associated quantity
